# A 2D "Unknown" (FOR NOW) Game using SDL and C++

### A little note on why I left OpenGL:
### I understand that OpenGL is just a graphics API but not a "graphics library". It's been fun learning OpenGL but i guess it's time to switch to SDL because how little time i have in these 3-4 months(Exams). I takes literally days or sometimes weeks to get some basic thing working. So SDL is going to be my last choice, there is no switch back. I promise one day i will make something in pure OpenGL.

This is a complete game that's going to be made in SDL and C++. Not a 3D one but should be good for a starter like me.
